# SMART WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING IOT

The idea behind this project is to control the water pumps using our mobiles with the help of internet and radio waves emittied from a SIM card.
we use a free IOT Cloud Platform "Blynk" to upload our data to the cloud and to control the water pump. The Blynk app uses internet to work. Incase of no internet, a GSM module is also connected to control the motor pumps
